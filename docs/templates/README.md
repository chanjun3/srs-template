# Templates

Reusable blueprints that can be embedded inside new SRS packages. Templates must
be technology-agnostic and accompanied by change logs.

Available sets:

- `3layer/` – reference AI stack split into presentation, reasoning, and data
  management layers.

When publishing a new template, document how it should be consumed (copy, link,
or extend) and keep shared configs under `../case-studies/config/`.
