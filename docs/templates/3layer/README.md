# 3-layer reference template

This folder centralises every artefact related to the “3-layer” reference
architecture. The files map one-to-one with the canonical SRS sections:

| Section | File |
| --- | --- |
| Architecture overview | `architecture_overview.md` |
| Functional requirements | `functional_requirements.md` |
| Non-functional requirements | `non_functional_requirements.md` |
| Integration requirements | `integration_requirements.md` |
| Data schema | `data_schema.md` |
| Quality assurance | `quality_assurance.md` |

Because these assets previously lived in separate numbered directories, all
links have been updated to use relative paths from the repo root. When making
changes, please reflect them in the table above and in the global `CHANGELOG.md`.
