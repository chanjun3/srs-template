# Governance & policy

Use this directory for specifications that define how teams collaborate,
version, and govern data. Current artefacts:

- `Branch_Management_Requirements.md` – branching model, approval roles, and release lanes.
- `Data_Utilization_Policy_SRS.md` – privacy, labeling, and audit obligations.

When adding similar docs, include RACI tables or explicit ownership sections so
cross-functional stakeholders know their responsibilities.
