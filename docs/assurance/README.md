# Assurance artefacts

Specifications that describe quality strategy, verification matrices, and CI/CD
pipelines. Present contents:

- `CI_CD_Pipeline_SRS.md` – pipeline topology, gate checks, promotion flow.
- `AI_Literacy_Development_System_SRS.md` – QA playbook for the education / knowledge system.

Link test evidence (dashboards, coverage reports, etc.) from here or from the
global change log when introducing new assurance mechanisms.
