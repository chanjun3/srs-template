# Data requirement blocks

Use this folder for schemas, lineage descriptions, and retention policies that
are shared across systems. Current artefact:

- `CognitiveLoggingArchitecture.md`

When referencing configs located under `docs/case-studies/config/`, prefer
relative links (e.g. `../../case-studies/config/cognitive_loop.yaml`) so
diagrams stay in sync.
