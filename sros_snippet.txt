55:
56:## (1) Syntax Invariants
57:
58:- CI YAML indentation SHALL be exactly 2 spaces per nesting level, and any
59:  deviation invalidates the workflow.
60:- Tabs, full-width spaces, and mixed indentation sequences SHALL be rejected
61:  within every YAML rule block.
62:- `run: |` multi-line command blocks SHALL preserve consistent indentation for
63:  all included lines relative to the `run` key and SHALL NOT introduce stray
64:  spacing.
65:- HEREDOC style sections SHALL close with an indentation that exactly matches
66:  their opener; mismatched indentation invalidates the block.
67:- Steps under `jobs.lint.steps` SHALL remain correctly nested; any mis-nesting
68:  that moves steps outside this hierarchy invalidates the YAML.
69:
70:## (2) Failure-Handling Semantics
71:
72:- Lint steps that specify `continue-on-error: true` SHALL continue execution
73:  while still recording failure status for downstream guards.
74:- A fail guard such as `if: failure()` SHALL be present to ensure the workflow
75:  reacts deterministically to prior lint failures.
76:- Steps using `if: always()` for log generation and artifact upload SHALL
77:  execute regardless of previous outcomes to guarantee evidence capture.
78:- Always-run steps SHALL only be employed when upstream steps cannot abort the
79:  job; otherwise the workflow risks silent termination.
80:
81:## (3) CIFixerAgent Interface Contract
82:
83:- The produced artifact SHALL be named `srs-ci-logs` and no other identifier is
84:  permitted.
85:- The artifact contents SHALL include `${{ github.workspace }}/ci-summary.log`
86:  exactly at that path.
87:- Presence of the artifact is a REQUIRED precondition for CIFixerAgent triage;
88:  absence SHALL block FixerAgent execution.
89:- Any modification to artifact name, path, or structure SHALL be treated as a
90:  breaking change that requires explicit SRS approval.
91:
92:## (4) Observability & Critical Fault Definitions
93:
94:- Workflow silent invalidation SHALL be defined as a lint workflow executing
95:  without emitting logs or artifacts despite configuration requiring them.
96:- Silent invalidation SHALL be classified as a Critical SRS Violation and SHALL
97:  trigger escalation.
98:- A CI workflow that does not appear in GitHub Actions SHALL be deemed invalid
99:  and SHALL NOT be processed by FixerAgent.
100:- Missing required artifacts SHALL be classified as infrastructure faults and
101:  SHALL NOT be attributed to FixerAgent failures.
102:
103:## (5) Integration Requirements: Self-Healing Pipeline
104:
105:- The upstream workflow titled `Debug AI Agent Automation` SHALL remain
106:  immutable in name; downstream triggers SHALL reference the exact string and
107:  any renaming requires explicit SRS approval.
108:- The upstream workflow SHALL upload an artifact named `pytest-logs` whose
109:  contents include the file `pytest_output.txt`; omission of either identifier
110:  constitutes a contract breach.
111:- Upstream workflows SHALL invoke `pytest` via `set -euo pipefail` and MUST
112:  terminate using `exit "${PIPESTATUS[0]}"` (or equivalent) so that non-zero
113:  statuses propagate to `workflow_run.conclusion`.
114:- The downstream workflow `FixerAgent Self-Healing Pipeline` SHALL trigger
115:  exclusively via `workflow_run` events originating from `Debug AI Agent
116:  Automation` executions whose `conclusion` equals `failure`.
117:- Artifact IO contracts SHALL guarantee that FixerAgent consumes
118:  `artifacts/pytest_output.txt` extracted from the `pytest-logs` artifact
119:  without renaming the directories or files.
120:- The upstream/downstream relationship (Debug AI Agent Automation →
